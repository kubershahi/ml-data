A good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters . Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was aseparate and laborious process to get it going .\", \"Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, and the problem they solved was an urgent one . But in fact they're famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition . There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually . The mistake they make is tounderestimate the power of compound\", \" Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in users made the difference between success and failure . It's harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup; they'll change their minds when they see growth .\", ' Wufoo sent each new user a hand-written thank you note after you bought a laptop . Why do we have to teach startups this? Why is it counterintuitive for founders? One reason is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers, and customer service is not part of the training of engineers .', ' Steve Jobs used \"insanely\" as a synonym for \"very\" when he started using that phrase . He meant it more literally — that one should focus on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be pathological . For most successful startups it\\'s a necessary part of the feedback loop that makes the product good.', \" The strategy works just as well if you don't do it unconsciously.

It's a common mistake among inexperienced founders to believe that a partnership with a big company will be their big break . It's not enough just to do something extraordinary initially, says the author . But getting users will always be a gradual process, he says .\", \" The need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of start-up ideas as scalars .
